phpredis 3.0.0

  This version of phpredis supports cluster and is intended for php versions
  7.0.0 and higher.  To compile cluster-enabled phpredis for older versions
  of php, please use the 2.2.8 pecl package.

  A huge thanks goes out to Sean DuBois for doing all the work required to get
  phpredis working in php 7.0!

  new commands that have been introduced to Redis since our last release.

  A special thanks to everyone who helps the project by commenting on issues and
  submitting pull requests!  :)

  [NEW] Support for the BITPOS command
  [NEW] Connection timeout option for RedisArray (@MikeToString)
  [NEW] A _serialize method, to complement our existing _unserialize method
  [NEW] Support for the PUBSUB command
  [NEW] Support for SCAN, SSCAN, HSCAN, and ZSCAN
  [NEW] Support for the WAIT command

  [FIX] Handle the COPY and REPLACE arguments for the MIGRATE command

  [DOC] Fix syntax error in documentation for the SET command (@mithunsatheesh)
  [DOC] Homebrew documentation instructions (@mathias)

phpredis 2.2.4

   **
   ** Features / Improvements
   **

   * Randomized reconnect delay for RedisArray @mobli
     This feature adds an optional parameter when constructing a RedisArray object
     such that a random delay will be introduced if reconnections are made,
     mitigating any &apos;thundering herd&apos; type problems.

   * Lazy connections to RedisArray servers @mobli
     By default, RedisArray will attempt to connect to each server you pass in
     the ring on construction.  This feature lets you specify that you would
     rather have RedisArray only attempt a connection when it needs to get data
     from a particular node (throughput/performance improvement).

   * Allow LONG and STRING keys in MGET/MSET
   * Extended SET options for Redis &gt;= 2.6.12
   * Persistent connections and UNIX SOCKET support for RedisArray
   * Allow aggregates for ZUNION/ZINTER without weights @mheijkoop
   * Support for SLOWLOG command
   * Reworked MGET algorithm to run in linear time regardless of key count.
   * Reworked ZINTERSTORE/ZUNIONSTORE algorithm to run in linear time

   **
   ** Bug fixes
   **

   * C99 Compliance (or rather lack thereof) fix @mobli
   * Added ZEND_ACC_CTOR and ZEND_ACC_DTOR @euskadi31
   * Stop throwing and clearing an exception on connect failure @matmoi
   * Fix a false positive unit test failure having to do with TTL returns
